            <p>It’s easy to take our cars for granted, given how easy it is to fill a gas tank.  Yet the process of taking crude oil (petroleum) from the ground and turning it into gasoline and other fuels is long and elaborate. </p>
            <p>
Nearly all of the fuel used for transportation today comes from crude oil. When it is brought out of the ground, it has to be transported in pipelines, trucks, or ships across vast distances.  The engineering required for oil transport can be substantial.  The Trans Alaska Pipeline System that runs from the North Slope of Alaska to the city of Valdez on Alaska’s southern coast is 800 miles long.  A new pipeline in Russia and Siberia called the Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean Pipeline will run 2,900 miles (4,700 km) when it is completed around 2014.  
			</p>
            <p>
After oil has been transported, it has to be converted at refineries into secondary fuels such as gasoline. Crude oil contains a wide variety of hydrocarbons, molecules made from hydrogen and carbon.  These hydrocarbons are used for a variety of purposes, including fuels in liquid and gas forms. Crude oil is separated into these fuels through a process called fractional distillation that uses heat and chemical reactions to separate molecules into different groups.  These final products include not only gasoline and diesel fuels but also other products such as asphalt for roads, oils for engines, and specialized fuels for airplanes.
