    /*
     * This is a Multiple Choice Question bric template.
     *
     * Edit the "question" string, the "choices" array and the "answerKey.answers" object
     * below, leave everything else as it is.
     *
     * The choices "answerKey" value matches the "answerKey.answers" property name.
     * So every choice must have a matching entry in the "answerKey.answers".
     *
     * A "score" of 0 means incorrect, a "score" of 1 means correct.
     *
     * A helpful hint:
     *   if you change the number of choices, remember that both the choices
     *   and the answers must be separated by commas, but that the last one
     *   should not have a trailing comma.
