A Quick Prototype, Interactives 'library' with activitymanager
===========

This expands upon one of Nyo's earlier activitymanager POC's.  
Their original is activitymanager.js.  It's in the js directory so we
can compare against my changes in activitymanager-seann.js

They used amplify.js for sub/pub so I'm using that instead of our home-rolled
eventmanager which seems to be ok (at least the subscribe test).

This just puts a couple of widget buttons on the page.  I'll expend this
to demonstrate nested widgets and more complex eventing.

This is also an example of a different object construction pattern.
